# Responsive React App

This is a responsive React application built using JSX and Tailwind CSS. The application demonstrates a component-based architecture, state management with hooks, and the Context API for theme management. It also integrates with an external API to fetch and display data.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The app is structured into reusable components, promoting maintainability and scalability.
- **Theme Management**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes using the Context API.
- **API Integration**: The application fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays it dynamically.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React hooks for managing state and side effects.
